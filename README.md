# House_Price_Prediction_with_inputs (Kaggle Dataset)

House is a basic necessity of our life. Besides providing shelter, it is a major form of individual wealth. Understanding its price movements is important for a number of reasons. Changes in its value may influence consumer spending and saving decisions, which in turn affect overall economic activity. Changes in housing prices impact and reflect the health of the residential investment sector, a major source of employment. More importantly, many fundamental factors that shape the marketâ€™s expectations of future supply and demand relating to house price movements are not directly observable. As a result, it is difficult to ascertain whether rapid shifts in house prices are reflecting changes in the underlying fundamentals or not.

 In this context, it is essential to have accurate measure of aggregate housing prices.
